# Where is the code?

The mypyc implementation and documentation live in the
[mypyc subdirectory](https://github.com/python/mypy/tree/master/mypyc) of
the [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) repository.

Since mypyc uses mypy for type checking, it's convenient to use a single
repository for both.

Note that the mypyc [issue tracker](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc/issues) lives
in this repository! Please don't file mypyc issues in the mypy issue tracker.
